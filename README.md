# Reflex-Based Games with Tokenized Rewards


## Project Description
   Reflex-Based Games with Tokenized Rewards is a blockchain-powered gaming ecosystem that rewards players for their performance in skill-intensive, reflex-driven games. Players earn ReflexGameToken (RGT) as they achieve milestones, win tournaments, or complete challenges in the game. RGT tokens can be used for purchasing in-game items, trading on exchanges, or participating in staking for additional rewards.
